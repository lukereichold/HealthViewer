Seamlessly export & view iOS Health data

## What's the point?
Ever wanted to view your iOS Health data in closer detail or on a larger screen? How about export it as a PDF, email it to your doctor, or print it out?

Currently, this functionality doesn't exist within iOS. The only way to get your iOS Health data off your phone requires emailing a .zip folder containing an obscure XML file to yourself, which your computer doesn't know how to process.

This simple web app serves as a proof of concept system for easily exporting iOS Health data from your phone as well as securely viewing it in a browser environment.

## How it works
1. Generate a unique ID / email address.

2. From the iOS health app, tap the Health Data tab, "All", then tap the arrow in the top-right corner. Export to the email address given in the previous step.

3. Return to this app, and enter your unique ID generated before. You will then be able to view, print, and export custom segments of your health data. Your data will be available for 24 hours using this ID.

HealthViewer removes any identifying information from the data it receives. With no accounts and data that's cleared every 24 hours, privacy is ensured.
