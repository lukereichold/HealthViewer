      h2 What's the point?
      p Ever wanted to view your iOS Health data in closer detail or on a larger screen? How about export it as a PDF, email it to your doctor, or print it out? 
      p Currently, this functionality doesn't exist within iOS. The only way to get your iOS Health data off your phone requires emailing a .zip folder containing an obscure XML file to yourself, which your computer doesn't know how to process.
      p This simple web app serves as a proof of concept system for easily exporting iOS Health data from your phone as well as securely viewing it in a browser environment.

      h2 How it works
      p
        | 1. 
        a(href="/generate") Generate a unique ID / email address.
      p 2. From the iOS health app, tap the Health Data tab, "All", then tap the arrow in the top-right corner. Export to the email address given in the previous step.
      p 
        | 3. Return to this app, and 
        a(href="/viewer") enter your unique ID
        |  generated before. You will then be able to view, print, and export custom segments of your health data. Your data will be available for 24 hours using this ID.
      p 
        b HealthViewer removes any identifying information from the data it receives. With no accounts and data that's cleared every 24 hours, privacy is ensured.
